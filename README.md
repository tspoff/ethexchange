# ETHExchange
A simple exchange for trading ether and ERC20 tokens on testnets, designed as an educational exercise.

Users can deposit and withdraw ether & tokens between their wallet and exchange, and submit orders.
Buy/sell orders are automatically filled if possible given current unfilled orders.
